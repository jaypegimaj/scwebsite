      <h2>Susan is the absolute best!</h2>
      <p>Susan helped me to design a bathroom remodel and redecorate my family room. She even gave me some tips to update my living room without re-doing it. I've worked with 3 other designers in the past, and Susan is the absolute best! She works wonders on any budget and she stays on budget. She has a great sense of style and really listens to what the client wants. She is honest about what will and will not work, and she works tirelessly to find a design sure to please the client. We spent a lot of hours coming up with the perfect design for my bathroom, and it shows in the results. I get a lot of complements on my bathroom. She also drew up plans, shopped for materials, and works well with the contractor. I will always use Susan for any future home design needs I have.<br />

      <h2>Can't wait to work with Susan again</h2>
      <p>Susan did an excellent job on my master bathroom remodel. She was very friendly and a real pleasure to work with. She was able to listen to what I had in mind, incorporate my taste into the redesign creating something I love, all while managing to stay within my budget. Susan was always prompt in returning phone calls and emails and always arrived to our meetings on time. She was always on top of all the planning and kept me involved every step of the way. I love my new bathroom, and can't wait to work with Susan again on my next remodeling job (my kitchen)!<br />

      <h2>Pleasure to work with</h2>
      <p>Susan was easy work with. She listened to us and provided a beautiful design that met our requirements. She was always ready with suggestions and solutions to anything that came up.

      <h2>Her passion for design is obvious!</h2>
      <p>It was my good fortune to be referred to Susan Clouse Interior Solutions by the contractor we chose. Being closely associated facilitated both the planning and completion stages of our project. 
During our bathroom remodel, Susan demonstrated enthusiasm for her role. She was readily available to assist in material and color choices. Her showroom offers adequate selection of products for cabinetry, counter tops, and tile accents. I was even able to borrow samples to view in my home and use for purchasing coordinating decor.
Susan listened to our needs and tastes then offered solid design ideas to support them and modernize our style.
Susan kept in contact with us and the companies we placed orders with for follow-through. As in most projects, adjustments needed to be made, but she arrived on site to verify material deliveries and installation procedures.
Susan was approachable, considerate, and flexible. Her passion for design is obvious!

      <h2>I'd highly recommend Susan for your project</h2>
      <p>Susan is the absolute best! contacted Susan in the middle of my master bathroom remodel, to help with tile selection. She is a pleasure to deal with! She had some great ideas, from lighting to color, and helped select a combination of marble, glass and ceramic tile that beautifully complemented my new decor. I only wish I had found her at the very beginning of my project! Lesson learned for next time, but I'd highly recommend Susan for your project<br />

<h2>Trustworthy,   professional</h2>
      <p>I needed (wanted) to remodel/update my bathroom so I went to a bathroom   showroom to begin the process of picking out fixtures. I was in the store about   5 minutes when I turned around and left. There were too many choices. When I got   to my car I immediately called Susan and screamed HELP! She came over and we sat   down and talked about what I wanted. We looked through books and magazines and I   felt that she really listened to me and my needs. I then left the whole project   in her hands. Susan was very professional. Susan did an excellent job picking   out everything from tile, cabinet, etc, to towels. My bathroom now outshines the   rest of the house. Susan, HELP!<br />

      <h2>Susan   was wonderful!</h2>
      <p>Susan came to our home to help us pick out paint colors to go with the   existing furniture and artwork that we already had. Susan was extremely helpful,   not only giving her own insight, but showed us how to make something good even   better! Susan is wonderful to work with and extremely professional. I would call   on Susan again if needed.<br />

      <h2>Very   professional</h2>
      <p>Susan came to my home to show me different window treatment options and I was   very impressed with her knowledge and ideas. I was fairly clueless on what to do   with my windows and she came up with some great ideas for me!<br />

      <h2>Amazing   service</h2>
      <p>Recently I ordered Hunter Douglas blinds through Susan. She was here   promptly, offered very practical suggestions on what would be the best blinds   for my situation and brought samples to illustrate the style and colors in which   the blinds were available. She measured perfectly, and to my amazement, the   blinds were delivered &amp; installed in an extremely short period of time. I   will never &quot;do it myself&quot; again. This went so smoothly from start to finish - it   was amazing.<br />
